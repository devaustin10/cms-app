Repository (Data) Layer Testing:

Focuses on interactions with the database and ensuring that data is being read, written, and updated correctly.
Positive tests at this layer validate that data is being stored, retrieved, and manipulated as expected.
Negative tests at this layer might focus on database constraints, handling exceptions, and ensuring that improper data operations are appropriately prevented.
However, extensive negative testing related to business logic and validations should ideally be left to higher layers, such as the service layer.

Service Layer Testing:

Focuses on business logic, application rules, and orchestrating interactions between various components.
Positive tests at this layer validate that the service methods produce the expected results when given valid inputs and when following the application's business rules.
Negative tests at this layer are particularly important for testing how your application handles invalid or unexpected inputs, as well as how it responds to various error conditions. This includes testing scenarios like validation failures, business rule violations, and exception handling.

Controller (Presentation) Layer Testing:

Focuses on the interactions with the outside world, such as HTTP requests and responses.
Positive tests ensure that your endpoints or APIs correctly handle requests and return appropriate responses.
Negative tests at this layer can include testing error handling and edge cases related to input validation and response codes.

The mvnw and mvnw.cmd files in your server root directory are part of the Maven Wrapper feature. Maven Wrapper is a small script that allows you to run a specific version of Maven for your project without requiring you to have Maven installed globally on your system.

Here's what each of these files does:

mvnw: This is the Maven Wrapper script for Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS). When you run ./mvnw, it checks if the appropriate version of Maven is available for your project. If not, it automatically downloads and uses the correct version defined in your project's .mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties file.

mvnw.cmd: This is the Maven Wrapper script for Windows systems. It serves the same purpose as the mvnw script but is meant to be used in a Windows command prompt or PowerShell.

The Maven Wrapper is helpful because it ensures that everyone working on the project uses the same version of Maven, which can help avoid version compatibility issues. It's especially useful when collaborating with other developers who might not have Maven installed or might have a different version of Maven.

The files you see in your server root directory are generated automatically when you create a new project using Spring Initializr or if you run the command to regenerate the wrapper files (./mvnw wrapper:wrapper or ./mvnw -N io.takari:maven:wrapper).

If you use these scripts to run Maven commands (like ./mvnw clean package), they'll ensure that the appropriate version of Maven is used for your project, even if you don't have Maven installed globally on your system. This can help provide a consistent and reproducible build environment across different development machines.
